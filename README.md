# SE-Basics-Workshop
This workshop helps us programmers learn how to create a repo in github and add multiple files to it.

In the first activity, I need to find a partner and discuss our favorite programming languages and why. 
Then we need to discuss if our favorite language is the one we are also most experienced with? If not, which language are we most experienced with?

In the next activity I need to complete a program (FIzzBuzz) in my local coding editor in the programming language of your choice.
